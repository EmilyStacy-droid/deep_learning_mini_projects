# Deep learning Mini Projects
This project comprises three mini projects and one final project:
1. [CNN](./CNN_Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection/hcd.ipynb) - Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect cancer.
2. [RNN](./RNN_Disaster_Tweet/nlp_disaster.ipynb) - Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to distinguish real and fake disaster-related tweets.
3. [GAN](./GAN_Monet_Photo/gan_Monet.ipynb) - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate Monet-style paintings.

## Additional Notes
- For more information, please refer to the inline comments in the code, as well as the accompanying markdown text.

- All mini-projects, along with the final project, were developed and executed on Google Colab, so file paths are structured accordingly.

## Final Project Overview: 
This project consists of three Jupyter notebooks:
1. [Final Movie Review](./Final_Movie_Review/final_movie_review.ipynb) - Covers the project introduction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), final analysis, and recommendations.
2. [Final_movie_review_pytorch.ipynb](./final_movie_review_pytorch.ipynb) â€“ Implements the model architecture and accuracy analysis using PyTorch.
3. [Final_movie_review_tensor_flow.ipynb](./final_movie_review_tensor_flow.ipynb) - Implements the model architecture and accuracy analysis using TensorFlow.

### Final Movie Review Execution Notes:
- Running both PyTorch and TensorFlow on the same environment can lead to dependency conflicts. To avoid this, first run Final_Movie_Review.ipynb to generate and save the train and test datasets. Then, use a cloud-based VM (e.g., Google Colab) to run the PyTorch and TensorFlow notebooks separately.
